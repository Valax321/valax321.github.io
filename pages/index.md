Hey, I'm a game developer from Melbourne, Australia. I mainly make first person games about exploring strange and sometimes disturbing environments. I work in Unity, Unreal or anything Quake-based.

I'm a programmer and I'm proficient in C#, C++ and Java, and have some experience with C, Javascript/Typescript, Lua and Python.
