Welcome to the website for Andrew Castillo, an Australian gamedev. I'm studying game design at RMIT University currently because I love crippling debt.

Outside of uni, I make stuff under the studio name [While False Studios](http://www.whilefalsestudios.com) and am also responsible for the terrible name.

Apart from gamedev, I occasionally write fiction, play bass guitar and go outside.

This site is a portfolio mainly, but I'll put random stuff here occasionally.
